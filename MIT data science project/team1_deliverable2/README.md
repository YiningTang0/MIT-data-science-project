**Race Classification**

For race classification, we use the API provided by US Census Bureau of 2000.

https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/surnames.2000.html

More detailed explanation and performance is in file `race_classification.ipynb` and `api.py`.


**Preliminary Analysis**

With the new classification of race, we did a second preliminary analysis focusing on the disparity on race.
It can be found in the `team1_preliminary_analysis2.ipynb` file.

**Second Question**

- Has this disparity changed over time and, if so, in what way?

For this question, we mainly answer it on the disparity of gender. We did have some findings which can be found
in the `team1_preliminary_analysis2.ipynb` file.

Since the race classification was done somewhat late, we have not included the graphs regarding disparity on race.
But taking a rough look on the race distribution, we found that White and Asian/Pacific American faculties contribute
the most that has a fairly higher number than other races.
